      Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
      This website is a vessel for research and reflection surrounding Evanston,
      Illinois’ historic movement to municipalize reparations for its African
      American residents. Structured much as an atlas, here you are invited
      explore a series of maps and diagrammatic illustrations of Evanston’s
      history, legislative process, and advocacy context concerning local
      reparations as a complex, multifaceted process. This collection features
      three main chapters, with a hearty appendix where you can find more
      reading and organizing materials for your own action-research.

      An Incomplete Atlas…
    </h3>
    <p>
      Unlike collections of maps you may have seen before, this collection is
      admittedly under construction and definitively incomplete. And, it will
      remain that way for some time. Maybe for all time. But, as a series of
      spatialized questions, its main objective is to contribute to generative
      research and reflection, acknowledgment and advocacy.
    </p>
    <h3>
      …where questions are destinations.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Campaigns for reparations have been varied in scale and tactics, but have
      always pursued direct repair for the generationally accumulated injustices
      against America’s black citizens. This atlas can only pull back some of
      those layers, but hopefully it might empower your own respectful,
      responsive, regenerative demands for tangible justice for our black
      neighbors. Our black neighbors matter. Local reparations can help make
      those matters into material means.
