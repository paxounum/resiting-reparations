          Map Summary
        </h6>
        <p>
          The Community Harms map explores the places, spaces, and policies
          which have limited black agency in Evanston, historically and present.
          Readers can click the mapped forms to find their definition and the
          historical, social, and/or political context behind the barriers.
        </p>
        <h6>
          Where Can I go with this Map?
        </h6>
        <p>
          This map is a collection of data points, lines, polygons, and
          narrative from national and local sources. First it draws on the
          collection of 17+ hand-drawn maps created as part of the
          <strong>Collective Cartography</strong> workshop run by me and my
          community partners between 2016 and 2019. You can click the <strong>EYE</strong> symbol
          by these lines to get more perspective on what they mean and why the
          community cartographers drew them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Readers are invited to see how the barriers drawn by community members
          line up with other factors in Evanston’s social, political, and
          economic landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Click the <strong>HOUSE</strong> symbol to see how the Home Owner’s Loan Corporation
          categories broke up Evanston. These geographies were borrowed from the
          fantastic project Mapping Inequality, which collected and
          georeferenced HOLC’s redlining maps in over 200 affected communities
          in America.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check out the physical barriers and zoning categories to see how these
          visible and invisible structures divide Evanston. Click on the
          <strong>AQUADUCT</strong> for some consideration about physical space, and click on the
          <strong>GRID</strong> to learn more about the mapped zoning categories.
        </p>
        <p>
          These layers were derived from findings in the report from the City of
          Evanston’s Reparations Subcommittee entitled “Evanston Policies and
          Practices Directly Affecting the African American Community, 1900-1960
          (and Present).” This working document compiled by Dino Robinson of
          Shorefront Legacy and Dr. Jenny Thompson, of the Evanston History
          Center, outlines other historical barriers worth considering in a
          litany of “harms” which have kept Black Evanstonians from housing,
          employment, business, and leisure activities which white residents may
          take for granted.
        </p>
        <h6>
          Intended Use of this Map
        </h6>
        <p>
          In connection with the Community Honor Map, this map seeks to expound
          on the complexity of black life in Evanston. In doing so you can use
          this map to investigate what barriers have and still exist to limit
          black thriving. In contrast to the Honor map, this map is styled more
          for free reading; you are encouraged to read your own story into
          existence, using the traces on the map as clues or evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Educators and students may find this map helpful as an expansion of
          place-based learning, and an exploration at how material and
          immaterial forces in our shared geography affect people’s livelihoods.
          Use this interdisciplinary tool to connect reading, history, civics,
          and the arts. Local representatives and organizers may find this map
          useful as the information is sourced both from technical archives as
          well as from citizen’s perceptions of space. As we get a better grasp
          of the political economies and social geographies of the harmed
          community, we can better examining the physical and invisible forces
          keeping their community from liberation.
